# SONAR dataset classification
This is the project written for the exam of the Advanced Machine Learning course in my PhD in Physics, Unibo.

In this project, I used the SONAR dataset (downloaded from https://datahub.io/machine-learning/sonar) to classify mines vs rocks and to find the machine learning algorithm with the best accuracy in this classification.

There are also some graphical representation using matplotlib, like this one.
